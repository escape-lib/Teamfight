# Teamfight

GitHub repo for plugin Teamfight intended for the boxfight server Hera.

### TODO

- Fully fix team handler (including kickplayer and showteam [offline players are green])
- Implement arena setup, inventories
- Implement redis & arena saving & team saving
- Implement team duels, player logouts & async thread redis-saving
- (low priority) refactor usermanager/teammanager/matchmanager to one class for basic functions (eg. update, add)
